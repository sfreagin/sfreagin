# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my personal GitHub. I'm currently exploring:
- Machine Learning algorithms and techniques
  -   e.g. regression, classification, clustering, neural nets, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNeighbors, Keras / Tensorflow
  -   e.g. gridsearching to tune parameters, dimensionality reduction techniques, time series analyses
- Quantum computing libraries
  - e.g. Qiskit, Cirq, pyquil (soon)

My education background is **Applied Math** and **Physics**, mostly quantum and statistical mechanics (shout-out to the Boltzmann Brains)

I'm *relatively* new to GitHub and still building a portfolio of interesting projects. Please have a look around!
