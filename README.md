# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my personal GitHub! 

I'm currently exploring:
- Structure and mathematics of Executive Compensation practices for publicly-traded companies
  - Data pulled from SEC.gov filings
  - Philosophical considerations, governance mechanisms, unintended consequences
- Machine Learning algorithms and techniques
  -   e.g. regression, classification, clustering, neural nets, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNeighbors, Keras / Tensorflow
  -   e.g. gridsearching to tune parameters, dimensionality reduction techniques, time series analyses
- Quantum computing libraries
  - e.g. Qiskit, Cirq, pyquil (soon)

My education background is **Applied Math** and **Physics**, including quantum and statistical mechanics (shout-out to the Boltzmann Brains). I also have professional experience in HR and Executive & Equity Compensation roles.

Thanks for visiting! Please have a look around.
