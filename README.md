# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my personal GitHub! 

I'm currently exploring:

- NLP and LLM applications
  - Check the [arXiv Explorer repo](https://github.com/sfreagin/arXiv_explorer/tree/main) and related [streamlit app](https://arxiv-explorer.streamlit.app)
  - Expanding on the above work, working towards a potential journal publication on *trends in academic research over time*
- Machine Learning algorithms and techniques for Graduate School projects
  -   e.g. regression, classification, clustering, neural nets, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNeighbors, Keras / Tensorflow
  -   e.g. gridsearching to tune parameters, dimensionality reduction techniques, time series analyses
- Structure and mathematics of Executive Compensation practices for publicly-traded companies
  - Data pulled from SEC.gov filings
  - Philosophical considerations, governance mechanisms, unintended consequences
- Quantum computing libraries
  - e.g. Qiskit, Cirq, pyquil (soon)

My education background is **Applied Math** and **Physics**, including quantum and statistical mechanics (shout-out to the Boltzmann Brains). I will complete a **Master's Degree in Data Science** in April 2024. I have professional experience in HR and Executive & Equity Compensation roles, marketing research, and the most love for natural and quantitative sciences.

Thanks for visiting! Please have a look around.
